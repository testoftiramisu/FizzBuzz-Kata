Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

This Kata taken from [codingdojo.org](http://codingdojo.org)

#### :crown: The FizzBuzz Kata
	
	Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
	For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
	For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
